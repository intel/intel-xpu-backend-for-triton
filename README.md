# Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\*

This is the development repository of Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\*, a new [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) backend for Intel® GPUs. Triton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton\* is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs. Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\* is a third party module used by triton to provide reasonable tradeoff between performance and productivity on Intel® GPUs.
