# Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\*

This is the development repository of Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\*, a new [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) backend for Intel GPUs. Triton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom deep learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA, but also with higher flexibility than other existing DSLs. Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\* is a module used by Triton to provide a reasonable tradeoff between performance and productivity on Intel GPUs.

# Setup Guide

Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\* serves as a backend for [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton). One should build from the Triton repo, instead of building from intel-xpu-backend-for-triton.

## Prerequisites

Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\* requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for building, and [Intel® Extension for PyTorch* ](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/) for running kernels on XPU.

Please follow [installation guide for Intel® Extension for PyTorch* ](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/latest/tutorials/installation.html#installation-guide) for the detailed process and make sure the associated driver and Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit are installed correctly.

Note that these two should be **built from the source** for now.

## Build Intel GPUs backend

```Bash
# Clone OpenAI/Triton
git clone https://github.com/openai/triton.git
cd triton
# Clone submodules
git submodule sync && git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs 0
```
Since we are at the active development stage, it is recommended to check to latest commit for `intel-xpu-backend-for-triton`:

```Bash
cd third_party/intel_xpu_backend
git checkout main && git pull
```

Now Build Triton with Intel XPU backend enabled:

```Bash
cd {triton-root-dir}
cd python
TRITON_CODEGEN_INTEL_XPU_BACKEND=1 python setup.py develop
```
