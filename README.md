# Building with a custom LLVM

Triton uses LLVM to generate code for GPUs and CPUs.  Normally, the Triton build
downloads a prebuilt LLVM, but you can also build LLVM from source and use that.

LLVM does not have a stable API, so the Triton build will not work at an
arbitrary LLVM version.

1. Find the version of LLVM that Triton builds against.  Check
`cmake/llvm-hash.txt` to see the current version. For example, if it says:
       49af6502c6dcb4a7f7520178bd14df396f78240c

   This means that the version of Triton you have builds against
   [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) 49af6502.

2. `git checkout` LLVM at this revision.  Optionally, make additional
   modifications to LLVM.

3. [Build LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).  For example, you might run

       $ cd $HOME/llvm-project  # your clone of LLVM.
       $ mkdir build
       $ cd build
       $ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON ../llvm -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir;llvm" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="host;NVPTX;AMDGPU"
       $ ninja

4. Build Triton as above, but set the following environment variables.

       # Modify as appropriate to point to your LLVM build.
       $ export LLVM_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/llvm-project/build

       $ cd <triton install>
       $ LLVM_INCLUDE_DIRS=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/include \
         LLVM_LIBRARY_DIR=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR/lib \
         LLVM_SYSPATH=$LLVM_BUILD_DIR \
         pip install -e python

# Tips for building

- Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CLANG_LLD=true` as an environment variable to use clang
  and lld.  lld in particular results in faster builds.

- Set `TRITON_BUILD_WITH_CCACHE=true` to build with ccache.

- Set `TRITON_HOME=/some/path` to change the location of the `.triton`
  directory where Triton's cache is located and downloads are stored
  during the build. By default, this is the user's home directory. It
  can be changed anytime.

- Pass `--no-build-isolation` to `pip install` to make nop builds faster.
  Without this, every invocation of `pip install` uses a different symlink to
  cmake, and this forces ninja to rebuild most of the `.a` files.

- VSCcode IntelliSense has some difficulty figuring out how to build Triton's C++
  (probably because, in our build, users don't invoke cmake directly, but
  instead use setup.py).  Teach vscode how to compile Triton as follows.

    - Do a local build. Run command `pip install -e python`
    - Get the full path to the `compile_commands.json` file produced by the build:
      `find python/build -name 'compile_commands.json' | xargs readlink -f`.
      You might get a full path similar to `/Users/{username}/triton/python/build/cmake.macosx-11.1-arm64-cpython-3.12/compile_commands.json`
    - In vscode, install the
      [C/C++
      extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools),
      then open the command palette (`Shift + Command + P` on Mac, or `Shift +
      Ctrl + P` on Windows/Linux) and open `C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)`.
    - Open "Advanced Settings" and paste the full path to
      `compile_commands.json` into the "Compile Commands" textbox.

# Running tests

There currently isn't a turnkey way to run all the Triton tests, but you can
follow the following recipe.

```shell
scripts/test-triton.sh
```

# Tips for hacking

For detailed instructions on how to debug Triton's frontend, please refer to this [tutorial](https://triton-lang.org/main/programming-guide/chapter-3/debugging.html). The following includes additional tips for hacking on Triton's backend.

**Helpful environment variables**

- `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` dumps the IR before every MLIR pass Triton runs, for all
   kernels. Use `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=kernelName` to dump for a specific kernel only.
  - Triton cache can interfere with the dump. In cases where `MLIR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` does not work, try cleaning your triton cache: `rm -r ~/.triton/cache/*`
- `LLVM_IR_ENABLE_DUMP=1` dumps the IR before every pass run over the LLVM IR.
- `TRITON_INTERPRET=1` uses the Triton interpreter instead of running on the
  GPU.  You can insert Python breakpoints in your kernel code!
- `TRITON_ENABLE_LLVM_DEBUG=1` passes `-debug` to LLVM, printing a lot of
  debugging information to stdout.  If this is too noisy, run with just
  `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY` instead to limit the output.

  An alternative way to reduce output noisiness is running with
  `LLVM_IR_ENABLE_DUMP=1`, extract the IR before the LLVM pass of interest, and
  then run LLVM's `opt` standalone, perhaps passing `-debug-only=foo` on the
  command line.
- `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY=<comma-separated>` is the equivalent of LLVM's
  `-debug-only` command-line option. This limits the LLVM debug output to
  specific pass or component names (which are specified using `#define
  DEBUG_TYPE` throughout LLVM and Triton) in order to allow the debug output to
  be less noisy. `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY` allows for one or more comma
  separated values to be specified (eg
  `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY="tritongpu-remove-layout-conversions` or
  `TRITON_LLVM_DEBUG_ONLY="tritongpu-remove-layout-conversions,regalloc"`).
- `USE_IR_LOC={ttir,ttgir}` reparses the IR such that the location information
  will be the line number of the IR file with that particular extension,
  instead of line number of the python file. This can provide a direct mapping
  from the IR to llir/ptx. When used with performance tools, it can provide a
  breakdown on IR instructions.
- `TRITON_PRINT_AUTOTUNING=1` prints out the best autotuning config and total time
  spent for each kernel after autotuning is complete.
- `DISABLE_LLVM_OPT` will disable llvm optimizations for make_llir and make_ptx
  if its value is true when parsing as Bool. Otherwise, it will be parsed as a list
  of flags to disable llvm optimizations. One usage case is
  `DISABLE_LLVM_OPT="disable-lsr"`
  Loop strength reduction is known to cause up to 10% performance changes for
  certain kernels with register pressure.
- `TRITON_ALWAYS_COMPILE=1` forces to compile kernels regardless of cache hit.
- `MLIR_ENABLE_TIMING` dumps the timing information for each MLIR pass.
- `LLVM_ENABLE_TIMING` dumps the timing information for each LLVM pass.
- `TRITON_DEFAULT_FP_FUSION` overrides the default behavior of allowing fp fusion (mul+add->fma).
- `MLIR_ENABLE_REMARK` enables the performance warnings that are emitted as remarks.

# Usage Guide

## Code Modifications
Intel® XPU Backend for Triton\* doesn't require any modifications and will work with PyTorch 2.4 release out of the box.

1. Add `import torch` for xpu support.
2. Put the tensor and models to XPU by calling `to('xpu')`.

The following examples show modifications for the user code.

### Example 1 : Triton Kernel

This example is a modified version of [Vector Add](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/01-vector-add.html#vector-addition) triton kernel. Please refer to [Vector Add](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/01-vector-add.html#vector-addition) for detailed comments and illustration about the code semantics.

Comparing to the original code, the following code modifies:

```Python
import torch
import triton
import triton.language as tl


@triton.jit
def add_kernel(
    x_ptr,
    y_ptr,
    output_ptr,
    n_elements,
    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,
):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    mask = offsets < n_elements
    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)
    output = x + y
    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)

def add(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):
    # Put the tensor to xpu
    output = torch.empty_like(x).xpu()
    assert x.is_xpu and y.is_xpu and output.is_xpu
    n_elements = output.numel()
    grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)
    add_kernel[grid](x, y, output, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)

    return output

# For manual_seed, needs to use API for XPU
torch.xpu.manual_seed(0)
size = 512
# For tensors, needs to be put on XPU
x = torch.rand(size, device='xpu')
y = torch.rand(size, device='xpu')
output_torch = x + y
output_triton = add(x, y)
print(output_torch)
print(output_triton)
print(
    f'The maximum difference between torch and triton is '
    f'{torch.max(torch.abs(output_torch - output_triton))}'
)
```


### Example 2 : End-to-End Model
Triton is transparent for end-to-end models. One could easily use `torch.compile` with `inductor` as backend by default. It will automatically generates triton kernel and gets benefit from it.


```Python
import torch
from torch._dynamo.testing import rand_strided

from torch.nn import *
class simpleModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # tensors inside model should be on xpu
        self.y = rand_strided((32, 8), (8, 1), device='xpu:0', dtype=torch.float32)

    def forward(self, x):
        z = x + self.y
        return z

# tensors passed to the model should be on xpu
x = rand_strided((32, 8), (8, 1), device='xpu:0', dtype=torch.float32)
xpu_model = simpleModel()
# Call torch.compile for optimization
optimized_mod = torch.compile(xpu_model)

graph_result = optimized_mod(x)
```

## More Examples on Tests
If you wish to take a look at more examples, please refer to the [Unit Tests](docs/test_docs/unit_tests.md) and [End-to-End Benchmark Tests](docs/test_docs/end_to_end_tests.md).


## Performance Analysis Guide

There are several ways of doing performance analysis. We recommend using `torch.profiler` for end-to-end performance analysis and using Intel® VTune™ Profiler for more detailed kernel analysis. We provide a comprehensive guide for those two:
1. [end_to_end_tests#profiling settings](docs/test_docs/end_to_end_tests.md#profiling-settings) section for using `torch.profiler`.
2. [VTune Profiling Guide](docs/VTune_Profiling.md) for kernel analysis.

Note that the user needs to explicitly set `TRITON_XPU_PROFILE=1` when the user needs to enable kernel profiling.

```Bash
export TRITON_XPU_PROFILE=1
```
