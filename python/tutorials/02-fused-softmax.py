"""
Fused Softmax
=============

In this tutorial, you will write a fused softmax operation that is significantly faster
than PyTorch's native op for a particular class of matrices: those whose rows can fit in
the GPU's SRAM.

In doing so, you will learn about:

* The benefits of kernel fusion for bandwidth-bound operations.

* Reduction operators in Triton.

# %%
# Motivations
# -----------
#
# Custom GPU kernels for elementwise additions are educationally valuable but won't get you very far in practice.
# Let us consider instead the case of a simple (numerically stabilized) softmax operation:

import torch

import triton
import triton.language as tl

torch.xpu.enable_sync_mode()


@torch.jit.script
def naive_softmax(x):
    """Compute row-wise softmax of X using native pytorch

    We subtract the maximum element in order to avoid overflows. Softmax is invariant to
    this shift.
    """
    # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
    x_max = x.max(dim=1)[0]
    # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
    z = x - x_max[:, None]
    # read  MN elements ; write MN elements
    numerator = torch.exp(z)
    # read  MN elements ; write M  elements
    denominator = numerator.sum(dim=1)
    # read MN + M elements ; write MN elements
    ret = numerator / denominator[:, None]
    # in total: read 5MN + 2M elements ; wrote 3MN + 2M elements
    return ret


# %%
# When implemented naively in PyTorch, computing :code:`y = naive_softmax(x)` for :math:`x \in R^{M \times N}`
# requires reading :math:`5MN + 2M` elements from DRAM and writing back :math:`3MN + 2M` elements.
# This is obviously wasteful; we'd prefer to have a custom "fused" kernel that only reads
# X once and does all the necessary computations on-chip.
# Doing so would require reading and writing back only :math:`MN` bytes, so we could
# expect a theoretical speed-up of ~4x (i.e., :math:`(8MN + 4M) / 2MN`).
# The `torch.jit.script` flags aims to perform this kind of "kernel fusion" automatically
# but, as we will see later, it is still far from ideal.

# %%
# Compute Kernel
# --------------
#
# Our softmax kernel works as follows: each program loads a row of the input matrix X,
# normalizes it and writes back the result to the output Y.
#
# Note that one important limitation of Triton is that each block must have a
# power-of-two number of elements, so we need to internally "pad" each row and guard the
# memory operations properly if we want to handle any possible input shapes:


@triton.jit
def softmax_kernel(output_ptr, input_ptr, input_row_stride, output_row_stride, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):
    # The rows of the softmax are independent, so we parallelize across those
    row_idx = tl.program_id(0)
    # The stride represents how much we need to increase the pointer to advance 1 row
    row_start_ptr = input_ptr + row_idx * input_row_stride
    # The block size is the next power of two greater than n_cols, so we can fit each
    # row in a single block
    col_offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
    input_ptrs = row_start_ptr + col_offsets
    # Load the row into SRAM, using a mask since BLOCK_SIZE may be > than n_cols
    row = tl.load(input_ptrs, mask=col_offsets < n_cols, other=-float('inf'))
    # Subtract maximum for numerical stability
    row_minus_max = row - tl.max(row, axis=0)
    # Note that exponentiation in Triton is fast but approximate (i.e., think __expf in CUDA)
    numerator = tl.exp(row_minus_max)
    denominator = tl.sum(numerator, axis=0)
    softmax_output = numerator / denominator
    # Write back output to DRAM
    output_row_start_ptr = output_ptr + row_idx * output_row_stride
    output_ptrs = output_row_start_ptr + col_offsets
    tl.store(output_ptrs, softmax_output, mask=col_offsets < n_cols)


# %%
# We can create a helper function that enqueues the kernel and its (meta-)arguments for any given input tensor.


def softmax(x):
    n_rows, n_cols = x.shape
    # The block size is the smallest power of two greater than the number of columns in `x`
    BLOCK_SIZE = triton.next_power_of_2(n_cols)
    # Another trick we can use is to ask the compiler to use more threads per row by
    # increasing the number of warps (`num_warps`) over which each row is distributed.
    # You will see in the next tutorial how to auto-tune this value in a more natural
    # way so you don't have to come up with manual heuristics yourself.
    num_warps = 4
    if BLOCK_SIZE >= 2048:
        num_warps = 8
    if BLOCK_SIZE >= 4096:
        num_warps = 16
    # Allocate output
    y = torch.empty_like(x)
    # Enqueue kernel. The 1D launch grid is simple: we have one kernel instance per row o
    # f the input matrix
    softmax_kernel[(n_rows, )](
        y,
        x,
        x.stride(0),
        y.stride(0),
        n_cols,
        num_warps=num_warps,
        BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE,
    )
    return y


# %%
# Unit Test
# ---------

# %%
# We make sure that we test our kernel on a matrix with an irregular number of rows and columns.
# This will allow us to verify that our padding mechanism works.

x = torch.randn(1823, 781, device='xpu')
y_triton = softmax(x)
y_torch = torch.softmax(x, axis=1)
assert torch.allclose(y_triton, y_torch), (y_triton, y_torch)

# %%
# As expected, the results are identical.

# %%
# Benchmark
# ---------
#
# Here we will benchmark our operation as a function of the number of columns in the input matrix -- assuming 4096 rows.
# We will then compare its performance against (1) :code:`torch.softmax` and (2) the :code:`naive_softmax` defined above.

# %%
# In the above plot, we can see that:
#  - Triton is 4x faster than the Torch JIT. This confirms our suspicions that the Torch JIT does not do any fusion here.
#  - Triton is noticeably faster than :code:`torch.softmax` -- in addition to being **easier to read, understand and maintain**.
#    Note however that the PyTorch `softmax` operation is more general and will work on tensors of any shape.
